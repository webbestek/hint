We take security seriously. If you believe you’ve found a vulnerability:

1. Email **security@webbestek.nl** with details and steps to reproduce.
2. Do **not** open a public issue for sensitive findings.
3. We’ll acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and work on a fix.

When fixed, we will issue a new release and credit reporters if they wish.
