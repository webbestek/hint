# FAQ

**Is it safe?**  
Yes. Hint files only **print** commands. They never execute anything for you.

**Does it need Starship?**  
No. Starship is optional. `sysline` works well with it, but `hint` runs fine without.

**Can I add my own tips?**  
Yes. Put them in `~/.config/hint/custom.sh`, one TAB‑separated line per tip.

**Why do commands show `<like-this>`?**  
They are placeholders. Replace them with values that make sense for you.

**What about Windows or macOS?**  
This project targets Linux (and WSL). Many commands work elsewhere, but not all.
