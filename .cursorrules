# Cursor rules for this repo
- Keep runtime Bash simple and fast; no network calls on startup.
- Hints must print TAB-separated lines: CATEGORY<TAB>LABEL<TAB>COMMAND<TAB>WHY
- Prefer single-pass pipelines; avoid subshell storms.
- After edits: run `scripts/fix-perms.sh` and `hint --doctor`.
- Keep diffs small; update docs when changing behavior.
