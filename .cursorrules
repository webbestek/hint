# Cursor Rules for the “hint” repo

- Runtime code (bin/, hint/) must be Bash and fast; avoid network calls and heavy loops.
- Emit hints as TAB-separated lines: CATEGORY<TAB>LABEL<TAB>COMMAND<TAB>WHY
- Prefer pipelines to loops; avoid Useless Use of Cat (UUOC).
- Keep changes small; preserve behavior unless explicitly asked.
- After edits, run: make lint && ./scripts/fix-perms.sh
