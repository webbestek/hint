We want this project to be a safe, welcoming place for everyone.

- Be respectful and considerate.
- No harassment, personal attacks, or hate speech.
- Assume good intent; ask for clarification when unsure.
- Keep feedback focused on code and docs, not people.

We will review in good faith and take appropriate action.
